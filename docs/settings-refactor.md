# Settings Section Refactor

## Overview

Complete redesign of the settings section with improved UX, modern patterns, and better organization.

## What Changed

### 1. Toast Notification System

**New Files:**

- `components/ui/toast.tsx` - Toast component and container
- `components/ui/toast-provider.tsx` - Global toast provider
- `lib/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Toast state management hook

**Benefits:**

- Replaced native `alert()` with modern toast notifications
- Better user feedback with success/error/warning variants
- Auto-dismissing notifications with manual close option
- Global state management using Zustand

### 2. Single-Level Navigation

**Before:** Two-level navigation (Account/Workspace sections â†’ nested tabs)
**After:** Single-level sidebar navigation with direct access to all sections

**New Structure:**

- Profile (personal information)
- Workspace (brand details and configuration)
- Team (member management)
- Billing (subscription and payments)

**Benefits:**

- Simpler navigation flow
- Clearer information architecture
- Faster access to specific settings
- Better visual hierarchy

### 3. Improved Components

#### Profile Section (`profile-section.tsx`)

- Clean form with first/last name editing
- Email display (read-only with explanation)
- Form validation
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Better loading states

#### Workspace Section (`workspace-section.tsx`)

- Brand name, website, and description editing
- Permission-based access control (admin/owner only)
- Clear permission notices for view-only users
- Empty state for no workspace
- Improved help text and placeholders

#### Team Section (`team-section.tsx`)

- Beautiful member cards with avatars
- Inline member invitation
- Role badges (Owner, Admin, Analyst)
- Plan-based member limits
- Improved permission handling
- Better empty states
- Role permission information

#### Billing Section (`billing-section.tsx`)

- Current plan display with features
- Visual plan cards
- Stripe Customer Portal integration
- Permission-based access (owner only)
- Clear action buttons
- Feature comparison

### 4. Better UX Patterns

**Before:**

- `alert()` for user feedback
- Excessive `useEffect` usage
- Mixed client/server state
- Inconsistent error handling

**After:**

- Toast notifications
- Minimal client-side state
- Proper error boundaries
- Consistent validation
- Better loading states
- Clear permission notices
- Helpful empty states

### 5. Removed Files

Old nested tab structure components (no longer needed):

- `account-settings.tsx`
- `workspace-settings.tsx`
- `profile-tab.tsx`
- `workspace-tab.tsx`
- `team-tab.tsx`
- `billing-tab.tsx`
- `my-workspaces-tab.tsx`
- `account-security-tab.tsx`
- `workspace-security-tab.tsx`

## Technical Improvements

### State Management

- Zustand for global toast state
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Better separation of concerns

### TypeScript

- Proper typing throughout
- Better type safety
- Consistent interfaces

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML
- Proper form labels
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation

### Performance

- Reduced component complexity
- Eliminated unnecessary re-renders
- Better code splitting

## Migration Notes

### For Users

- No data migration required
- Same functionality, better UX
- URL structure remains the same (`/dashboard/settings?section=...`)

### For Developers

- New toast system available globally via `useToast()` hook
- Section components follow consistent pattern
- Easy to add new settings sections

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { useToast } from "@/lib/hooks/use-toast";

function MyComponent() {
  const { success, error } = useToast();

  const handleAction = async () => {
    try {
      await doSomething();
      success("Success!", "Action completed successfully");
    } catch (err) {
      error("Error", "Something went wrong");
    }
  };
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future iterations:

- Account security section (password change, 2FA)
- Notification preferences
- API keys management
- Workspace activity log
- Advanced permissions matrix
