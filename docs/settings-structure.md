# Settings Structure - Final Design

## Overview

The settings section has been redesigned with better information architecture, grouping related features together.

## Navigation Structure

```
Settings
├── Profile (Personal settings)
│   └── Personal information, email
│
└── Workspace (Workspace settings)
    ├── General → Brand details and configuration
    ├── Team → Member management and roles
    └── Billing → Subscription and payments
```

## Why This Structure?

### Before (Problems)

- ❌ 4 separate sections (Profile, Workspace, Team, Billing)
- ❌ Team and Billing were at the same level as Profile
- ❌ Unclear relationship between features
- ❌ Confusing for users: "Is Team personal or workspace-specific?"

### After (Solution)

- ✅ 2 main sections (Profile, Workspace)
- ✅ Team and Billing are tabs within Workspace
- ✅ Clear separation: Personal vs Workspace settings
- ✅ Intuitive: "Team and Billing belong to the workspace"

## Components Structure

### Main Files

- `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` - Settings page (server component)
- `components/dashboard/settings/settings-nav.tsx` - Left sidebar navigation

### Profile Section

- `profile-section.tsx` - Personal information form

### Workspace Section

- `workspace-section-with-tabs.tsx` - Main workspace component with tabs
- `workspace-general-tab.tsx` - Brand details form
- `workspace-team-tab.tsx` - Team member management
- `workspace-billing-tab.tsx` - Subscription and billing

### Shared Components

- `components/ui/toast.tsx` - Toast notification component
- `components/ui/toast-provider.tsx` - Global toast provider
- `lib/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Toast state management hook

## Features

### Toast Notifications

Modern toast system that replaces native `alert()` calls:

```tsx
import { useToast } from "@/lib/hooks/use-toast";

const { success, error } = useToast();

success("Saved!", "Your changes have been saved");
error("Error", "Something went wrong");
```

### Permission System

Role-based access control throughout:

- **Analyst**: View-only access
- **Admin**: Can edit workspace settings and invite members
- **Owner**: Full access including billing

### Empty States

Proper empty states for:

- No workspace selected
- No team members
- Permission denied

## URL Structure

```
/dashboard/settings?section=profile
/dashboard/settings?section=workspace&tab=general
/dashboard/settings?section=workspace&tab=team
/dashboard/settings?section=workspace&tab=billing
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Clearer grouping of related settings
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new tabs to workspace
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed 12 old component files
4. **Modern Patterns**: Toast notifications, better error handling
5. **Accessibility**: Proper form labels, semantic HTML

## Statistics

- **Before**: 19 component files
- **After**: 7 component files
- **Files Removed**: 12
- **New Features**: Toast system, better permissions, empty states
