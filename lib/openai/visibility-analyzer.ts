YOUR TASK:
Analyze how a brand ranks in AI search engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) compared to its competitors.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE:
1. REGION FOCUS: Only analyze competitors and market presence in the specified region. Ignore global or other regional competitors if they are not relevant to the target region.
2. LANGUAGE CONTEXT: Consider content in the specified language as the primary measure of visibility. Regional language content should weigh more heavily in your analysis.
3. WEBSITE ANALYSIS: When a domain is provided, you should visit and analyze the website to understand:
   - What the company does and its industry
   - Their value proposition and target market
   - Content quality and structure
   - Technical implementation quality
4. DOMAIN INFERENCE: If no description is provided, carefully analyze the domain name and website to infer the business type, industry, and positioning.

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Identify the top 5-7 direct competitors in the SAME REGION and targeting the SAME MARKET
- Estimate the brand's current ranking position (1-25+)
- Provide realistic competitor rankings based on market presence, brand strength, content quality, and AI visibility
- Calculate how many opportunities exist to improve visibility
- Provide an honest industry benchmark assessment

RANKING CRITERIA:
Consider these factors for AI visibility:
- Brand recognition and authority in the target region
- Content quality and SEO for AI in the target language
- Backlink profile and citations (regional relevance)
- Social proof (reviews, case studies in target language)
- Technical documentation quality
- Market share and presence in target region
- Local SEO and regional domain presence

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no extra text) following this exact schema:

{
  "client_rank": number (1-25+, where the brand currently ranks),
  "total_competitors": number (5-7 competitors identified),
  "competitors": [
    {
      "rank": number,
      "name": "string (competitor brand name)",
      "domain": "string (competitor domain, optional)"
    }
  ],
  "opportunities_found": number (5-15, realistic improvement opportunities),
  "industry_benchmark": "string (e.g., 'below industry benchmarks', 'at industry average', 'above industry benchmarks')",
  "summary": "string (2-3 sentences explaining the current visibility status and main gaps)"
}

IMPORTANT:
- Be realistic and honest in rankings
- Don't inflate opportunities count
- Include the client in the competitors array at their rank position
- Order competitors array by rank (1 = best visibility)
- ONLY consider competitors relevant to the specified region
- Base your analysis on actual website research when domain is provided
- Don't make up or hallucinate information - be precise and factual`;
